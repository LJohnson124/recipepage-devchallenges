            <div class="list-item">
                <p class="list-number">1</p>
                <p class="list-instruction">Adjust the oven rack to the lower-middle position and preheat oven to 350°F
                    (177°C).</p>
            </div>


            <div class="list-item">
                <p class="list-number">2</p>
                <p class="list-instruction"><strong>Make the crust:</strong> Using a food processor, pulse the graham
                    crackers into crumbs. Pour into a medium
                    bowl and stir in sugar and melted butter until combined. (You can also pulse it all together in the
                    food processor.) Mixture will be sandy. Press firmly into the bottom and slightly up the sides of a
                    9-inch or 10-inch springform pan. No need to grease the pan first. I use the bottom of a measuring
                    cup to pack the crust down tightly. Pre-bake for 8 minutes. Remove from the oven and place the hot
                    pan on a large piece of aluminum foil. The foil will wrap around the pan for the water bath in step
                    4. Allow crust to slightly cool as you prepare the filling.</p>

            <div class="list-item">
                <p class="list-number">3</p>
                <p class="list-instruction"><strong>Make the filling:</strong> Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle
                    attachment, beat the cream cheese and granulated sugar together on medium-high speed in a large bowl
                    until the mixture is smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the sour cream, vanilla extract, and
                    lemon juice then beat until fully combined. On medium speed, add the eggs one at a time, beating
                    after each addition until just blended. After the final egg is incorporated into the batter, stop
                    mixing. To help prevent the cheesecake from deflating and cracking as it cools, avoid over-mixing
                    the batter as best you can.</p>
