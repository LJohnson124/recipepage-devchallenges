                    cracker crust, no one can deny its simple decadence. For the best results, bake in a water bath.</p>

            <div class="list-item">
                <p class="list-number">1</p>
                <p class="list-instruction">Adjust the oven rack to the lower-middle position and preheat oven to 350°F
                    (177°C).</p>
            </div>


            <div class="list-item">
                <p class="list-number">2</p>
                <p class="list-instruction"><strong>Make the crust:</strong> Using a food processor, pulse the graham
                    crackers into crumbs. Pour into a medium
                    bowl and stir in sugar and melted butter until combined. (You can also pulse it all together in the
                    food processor.) Mixture will be sandy. Press firmly into the bottom and slightly up the sides of a
                    9-inch or 10-inch springform pan. No need to grease the pan first. I use the bottom of a measuring
                    cup to pack the crust down tightly. Pre-bake for 8 minutes. Remove from the oven and place the hot
                    pan on a large piece of aluminum foil. The foil will wrap around the pan for the water bath in step
                    4. Allow crust to slightly cool as you prepare the filling.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="list-item">
                <p class="list-number">3</p>
                <p class="list-instruction"><strong>Make the filling:</strong> Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted
                    with a paddle
                    attachment, beat the cream cheese and granulated sugar together on medium-high speed in a large bowl
                    until the mixture is smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the sour cream, vanilla extract, and
                    lemon juice then beat until fully combined. On medium speed, add the eggs one at a time, beating
                    after each addition until just blended. After the final egg is incorporated into the batter, stop
                    mixing. To help prevent the cheesecake from deflating and cracking as it cools, avoid over-mixing
                    the batter as best you can.</p>

            <div class="list-item">
                <p class="list-number">4</p>
                <p class="list-instruction"><strong>Prepare the simple water bath (see note)</strong> Boil a pot of
                    water. You need 1
                    inch of water in your roasting pan for the water bath, so make sure you boil enough. I use an entire
                    kettle of hot water. As the water is heating up, wrap the aluminum foil around the springform pan.
                    Pour the cheesecake batter on top of the crust. Use a rubber spatula or spoon to smooth it into an
                    even layer. Place the pan inside of a large roasting pan. Carefully pour the hot water inside of the
                    pan and place in the oven. (Or you can place the roasting pan in the oven first, then pour the hot
                    water in. Whichever is easier for you.)</p>

                <p class="list-number">5</p>
                <p class="list-instruction">Bake cheesecake for 55-70 minutes or until the center is almost set. When
                    it’s done, the center of the cheesecake will slightly wobble if you gently shake the pan. Turn the
                    oven off and open the oven door slightly. Let the cheesecake sit in the oven in the water bath as it
                    cools down for 1 hour. Remove from the oven and water bath, then cool cheesecake completely at room
                    temperature. Then refrigerate the cheesecake for at least 4 hours or overnight.</p>

                    pan, then remove the rim. Using a clean sharp knife, cut into slices for serving. For neat slices,
                    wipe the knife clean and dip into warm water between each slice.</p>
